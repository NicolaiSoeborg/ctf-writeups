## Fun fact

This year we managed to land a 13 place, again!
(which is really a shame as top 12 gets swag ...)

Last year I had a lot of fun with the challenge [Personal Proxy](../../Real%20World%20CTF%203rd/Personal%20Proxy/)
and this year I was part of solving the challenge [Secured Java](./Secured%20Java/).
