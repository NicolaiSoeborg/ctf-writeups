I ran 'stegcracker.sh' using the rockyou wordlist and got a result in seconds:

$ stegcracker.sh NC3.jpg /wordlists/rockyou.txt
> Successfully cracked file with password: password1
> Your file has been written to: NC3.jpg.out

Looking at 'NC3.jpg.out' it contains a lot of base64 encoded content:
$ base64 -d NC3.jpg.out > NC3.b64decoded

Now it contains some morse encoded stuff.
Decoding this is easy, but then you get something with only 3 symbols: `.!?`

This could look like some exotic language (think Brainfuck).
Looking at some languages this seems to be a modified "Ook".
Decrypting gives:
  Ri tobrh tzoush: BQ3{goo_gboyysf_jw_goaas_gdfcu}

It's not ROT13, but using 'CyberChef' its easy to find that its ROT-12:
  Du fandt flaget: NC3{saa_snakker_vi_samme_sprog}
