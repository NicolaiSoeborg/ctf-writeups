# postquantumsig

_Our hot new cryptocurrency uses powerful techniques to make the asymmetric key signatures just as hard to crack on a quantum computer as a binary one. Maybe we forgot something though? Send some money to a weird address if you get any._

--------------------------------------------------------------

The challenge have some python code attached, but not much description of whats going on.
The included `signatures.csv` contains 77 transactions where people send _zuccoins_ to each other.

From the code (and name) of the challenge we came to conclude that the system implements the **Merkle signature scheme**.

So how does the Merkle signature scheme work?
Well, lets first checkout _Lamport one-time signature scheme_ to sign a single bit.

## Signing a single bit (quantum resistant!)

In the hash based tree below, our public key is the _Merkle root_ and `rnd0` and `rnd1` are some securely big random values.

Now to sign `bit is 0` we will reveal `rnd0` and `Hash(rnd1)` and everyone can calculate `a = Hash(rnd0)` and verify that `root == Hash(a || Hash(rnd1))`.

But note that revealing any of the leaves will mean that we **can't** reuse the signature, i.e. if anyone knows `rnd1` then signatures for both `bit is 0` and `bit is 1` can be forged.

## Signing multiple bits

We can extend the tree and sign multiple messages.

In the above example `a = Hash(A)`, `b = Hash(B)`, ..., `ab = Hash(a || b) = Hash(Hash(A) || Hash(B))`, etc.

We will use `a` and `b` to sign the first bit of the message, then use `c` and `d` to sign bit 2, and so forth.
Again, revealing `A` means `bit is 0` and revealing `B` means `bit is 1`.

To sign `1001` we will need to reveal all the yellow below:

![mermaid diagram of sign-1001.mmd](diagrams/sign-1001.png)

This is all fine, and we can extend the signature scheme to allow for signing multiple messages (in the python code attached, this is the `other` variable).

But when checking `signatures.csv` we found that one of the addresses (`9bca65c9376209ede04b5df3b02cb832f8997ff978069d171dc9cbfca657f91a`) always had a signature merkle hash of `878c9f44e5284cc3b0bd9ade03e5ad023f323f830b2588756ec5ed84ee124fb4`, e.g. he signed multiple different messages using the same one-time signature!

So lets see what happens in the above tree if we sign e.g. `0110`:

![mermaid diagram of sign-0110.mmd](diagrams/sign-0110.png)

Now we can combine the two signatures and will get to know `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, `E`, `F`, `G`, `H`, i.e. the whole private key!

## Solving the challenge

In the *postquantumsig* task we could use the same principle to extract the whole "512 hashes" private key
from the 10 messages `9bca65c9376209ede04b5df3b02cb832f8997ff978069d171dc9cbfca657f91a` signed (all with merkle root hash `878c9f44e5284cc3b0bd9ade03e5ad023f323f830b2588756ec5ed84ee124fb4`). We might have been unlucky that some of the private key secrets wouldn't have been revealed (in which case we couldn't sign the corresponding bits), but in this case the whole private key was leaked.

We used this to create a signature for:
`9bca65c9376209ede04b5df3b02cb832f8997ff978069d171dc9cbfca657f91a sent 13.37 zuccoins to aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa`

And vol√†:

```bash
python3 ./verifier.py | nc challenges.fbctf.com 8088
Enter signed transaction row:

```
